# Build and run `valid-assign`

1. Run bison/yacc to generate parser and headers (file name may differ):

bison -d assign.y

2. Run flex to create lexer C file:

flex assign.l

3. Compile:

gcc assign.tab.c lex.yy.c -o assign -lfl

4. Run:

./assign

Notes:
- If the lexer includes a header like `varval.tab.h` that isn't generated, check the .y filename and the generated header name; adjust the `#include` in the lexer or run bison with the correct .y filename.
- Always run `bison -d` before `flex` when the lexer includes parser-generated headers.
